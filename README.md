Standardizing R scripts used to create shiny dashboards for reporting scientific findings, doing simulations and estimation, and regulatory submissions is important for several reasons. It allows pharmacometricians in different organizations and companies to share and reuse code more easily. 

Standardized scripts reduce redundancy and ensure consistency in how results are presented. This becomes critical when dashboards are used for regulatory purposes, to demonstrate reproducibility and reliability of analyses to agencies. Standard templates and conventions in the scripts also help train new practitioners more efficiently. They act as a guide for best practices in dashboard design and formatting results. This is beneficial given the growth of data-driven applications like shiny. 

Standardization facilitates collaborations between researchers by providing a common framework and language for developing interactive analyses and visualizations. Overall, it improves the rigor, transparency and quality of pharmacometrics work that uses interactive reporting tools.
