#### Ideally, this is the section where you'd include the model description. However, for this template, it will be the section to explain some key features of this template. You may call it a sort of 'documentation'


## Documentation of this template

### Introduction

The purpose of this template is to help create a workflow for scientists to build robust shiny apps for their pharmacometric models combining the power of shiny and mrgsolve R packages. As you will already notice, an example is presented of a simple model to allow easy tweaking by the user to quickly create their preferred app.

### Features

The following features are available in the current template for you to get started.\

 - __User customizable interface__. This means the user can move around the panels to desired locations on the screen. They may also change the title of the panels to suit their needs. 
 - __Panel location and features saved across sessions__. This means that after re-arrangement of panels, changing panel colors or titles, one may refresh the page and the settings are retained.
 - Simulation inputs are already setup. Fields for setting up simulations, and regimen table for building regimen to compare groups are already set-up and configured in the server 
 - Auto detection of parameters and creation of inputs. Parameters within the mrgsolve file will automatically be detected and input fields will be created for them to allow the user to vary them.
 - Plot creation is configured. Simulation results will be used to create plots. Settings for plots can be toggled using the cog symbol on the right side of the plot panel. 
 - Summary of result and raw output. The results are configured to be automatically summarized to obtain key PK parameters.
 - Configured for speed. Continue effort is being made to improve the template to ensure great performance for simulation apps. 
 
 - Aesthetics for completion. App title are formatted to look professional. A sample icon is also provided, which may be replaced when updating the template to suit your need.
